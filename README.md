## What is BeatTree?

Created by Samara Mansoor, Kendra Go, and Liana Karim for SheInnovates 2025, BeatTree is a mobile app for DJs, producers, and music-lovers that centers around one of the most important things in music: tempo. BeatTree's UI prototype, created in Figma, showcases a fully-developed, high-tech, user-friendly mobile app, complete with features for collaboration, streaming, and more! When you select a song, BeatTree creates a tree with songs of a similar tempo, perfect for all your music-related needs. Additionally, BeatTree utilizes AI to create seamless transitions between the songs you add to your "Song Log"!

Still in development, BeatTree's Swift prototype currently includes many features, including the ability to search songs by artist, title, and tempo, a large database of songs of 125 different genres through the use of a CSV file from Kaggle, song suggestions of the same BPM of your selected song, and the ability to add songs to your "Song Log"! The future of BeatTree includes the full integration of our UI and code elements and more features to make our app great. 

Stay tuned! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŒ³
